## 3. PRODUCTS & SERVICES IN DETAIL

### 3.1 Gift Card Marketplace (for Consumers)

**What it is:** A curated digital marketplace where users can purchase gift cards from hundreds of brands.

**Key features:**
- **Instant delivery** — gift cards are delivered via email within seconds of purchase
- **100+ verified brands** including Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Apple, Visa, EA (Electronic Arts), Nike, Google Play, Starbucks, Target, Xbox, PlayStation, Roblox, Uber, Airbnb, Chipotle, CVS, Dunkin', GameStop, Old Navy, Panera, Papa John's, Bath & Body Works, Dick's Sporting Goods, Ulta, and many more
- **Discounts up to 25% off** on selected gift cards
- **Two types of gift cards:**
  - **Closed-Loop Gift Cards** — specific to a single retailer or brand (e.g., Amazon, Starbucks). Available to all users.
  - **Open-Loop Gift Cards** — usable at multiple merchants (e.g., Visa prepaid cards). Available to merchants.
- **Search, filter, and sort** by brand, category, store, discount, or popularity
- **12 cards per page** with full pagination support
- **Secure checkout** with industry-leading encryption; payment processing handled by third-party providers (Katron AI does not store full card numbers)

**Website vs App difference:** Gift card purchases made through the **website do not** earn KTN-R rewards. To earn KTN-R rewards on gift card purchases, users must purchase through the **Katron AI User App**.

**Categories available include:** Shopping, Dining, Entertainment, Travel, Gaming, Streaming, and more.

---

### 3.2 KTN-R Rewards Program

**What is KTN-R?**  
KTN-R is a **utility rewards token** proprietary to the Katron AI network. It is recorded within the Katron AI network.

**Important disclosures:**
- KTN-R is **not cash** and is **not redeemable for cash**
- KTN-R has **no monetary value** outside the Katron AI platform
- KTN-R is intended solely for use **within the KATRON PAY network** with participating merchants
- KTN-R is earned automatically on **eligible in-app purchases** — no loyalty card scanning, no code entry
- Website gift card purchases do **NOT** earn KTN-R

**How it works for users:**
1. User makes a payment at a participating merchant via the Katron AI app
2. The platform automatically detects and verifies the eligible purchase
3. KTN-R tokens are issued instantly to the user's in-app wallet
4. User can redeem KTN-R at participating merchants for discounts, offers, and special rewards

**Non-custodial wallet:** Where wallet functionality is enabled, the user's wallet is controlled entirely by the user. Katron AI does not have access to the user's wallet and cannot recover access if it is lost. Users should keep their wallet credentials safe.

**Rewards given away:** Katron AI has already distributed over **$1.7 billion in rewards**.

**Turn Receipts into Rewards:** Users can also earn points on receipts and redeem from popular gift cards (Amazon, Google Play, Starbucks, Nike, Target, Xbox, PlayStation, Roblox, Uber, Airbnb, Chipotle, CVS, Dunkin', GameStop, Old Navy, Panera, Papa John's, Bath & Body Works, Dick's Sporting Goods, Ulta, Visa, Barnes & Noble, and more), cash sweepstakes entries, or charitable donations.

## 6. MERCHANT API (Developer / Technical) — Full Reference

Katron AI provides a fully documented **RESTful API** for developers and merchants to integrate gift card purchasing programmatically into their applications.

**API Name:** KTN Gift Card Merchant API  
**Version:** v1.0 (Stable)  
**Base URL:** `https://api.ktngiftcard.katronai.com/katron-gift-card`  
**Communication:** HTTPS only, JSON request and response bodies  
**Authentication:** Bearer Token (JWT) sent to registered email upon profile creation  
**Documentation URL:** `www.katronai.com/api-docs`  

---

### 6.1 Introduction & Overview

The KTN Gift Card Merchant API is a RESTful service that lets you programmatically:
- List available gift cards
- Purchase gift cards
- Manage orders
- Retrieve gift card credentials (activation codes, PINs, redemption URLs)
- Handle refunds and voids
- Manage your merchant API profile and billing preferences

All endpoints are relative to the base URL. For example, `/api/merchant/getAccountDetails` resolves to:  
`https://api.ktngiftcard.katronai.com/katron-gift-card/api/merchant/getAccountDetails`

---

### 6.2 Authentication

The API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. When you create a Merchant API profile, an API key (JWT token) is sent to your registered email address. Include this token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MERCHANT_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Security rules:**
- Keep your API key secret — never share it in public repositories or client-side code
- If your key is compromised, regenerate it immediately from your API Profile page or by calling the reissue token endpoint
- Reissuing a token **immediately invalidates** the current one — update all integrations promptly

---

### 6.3 Quick Start (3 Steps)

**Step 1 — Create Your Merchant API Profile**  
Register as a MERCHANT user on KTN Gift Card, navigate to `/merchant-api` (API Profile), or call:

```
POST /api/user/createMerchantApiProfile?type=CHARGE_CARD
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_USER_JWT_TOKEN
```

Query parameter: `type` (required) — `CHARGE_CARD` or `CHARGE_ACCOUNT_BALANCE`

**Step 2 — Retrieve Your API Key**  
After profile creation, your API key (Bearer token) is sent to your registered email. Check spam/junk if you don't receive it. You can regenerate it at any time using the reissue token endpoint.

**Step 3 — Make Your First Request**  
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.ktngiftcard.katronai.com/katron-gift-card/api/merchant/giftCard/listGiftCards" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MERCHANT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

---

### 6.4 Charge Types

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `CHARGE_CARD` | Purchases charged directly to the credit/debit card on file. Best for pay-as-you-go usage. |
